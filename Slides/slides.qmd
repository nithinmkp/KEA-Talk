## Disclaimer 
- Research is not equivalent to expertise in tools  
- However, knowing these tools can save time

## Collaborative Research/Thesis/Dissertation


Imagine:  


- You’ve written a research draft and want feedback, so you email **draft.docx**.
- I add comments, make changes, and email you back **draft_Nithin_comments.docx**.
- You incorporate suggestions, add more sections, and send me **draft_v2.docx**.
- After a few more rounds, we end up with **draft_v5_final_FINAL.docx**.

![Messy Folder Example](version.jpg)

::: {.incremental}
- "How many of you have experienced this?"

##
![Multi-Format Problem](colab.jpg)

::: {.incremental}
- Different versions of the same file in multiple formats  
- Hard to track changes and collaborate efficiently  
- Example: 'paper.docx', 'paper.pdf', 'paper.tex', 'paper_final.docx'

## What if there was a better way
  - Automate documentation & results  
  - Use version control for tracking changes  
  - Ensure full reproducibility with open tools 

[Outcome  - Reproducible Research]{.huge-font-r}
---

## Why Reproducibility Matters {.scrollable}
- Replication crisis: Cases where results didn’t hold  
- **Top journals now require code submission**  
  - *American Economic Review (AER):* 
  - *The Economic Journal:*  
  - *Econometrica:* 
- **Even Research Associate positions now require fully reproducible code, including directory structure, even in Stata.**  

## The Economist’s Toolbox for Reproducibility    
- **Open-source programming tools** instead of proprietary software  
- **Quarto** for technical writing and reproducible reports  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## The Problem with Proprietary Software  
- Expensive licensing costs (SPSS, Stata, MATLAB)  
- Limited transparency and reproducibility  
- Dependency on vendor updates  
- Restrictions on sharing and collaboration  

## Open-Source Alternatives  
- **R & Python**: Powerful, free, and widely used in research  
- **Jupyter Notebooks & Quarto**: Interactive and reproducible analysis  
- **RStudio & VS Code**: User-friendly IDEs for research

---

## Reproducible Technical Writing with Quarto  
- Integrates code, text, and results  
- Avoids copy-pasting mistakes  
- Generates reports in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, Word) 

## Version Control: Git & GitHub in Action  
- Track changes efficiently  
- Collaborate without chaos  
- Revert to previous versions easily  



## A Reproducible Research Workflow  
1. **Step 1:** Organizing your project with Git  
2. **Step 2:** Analysis
3. **Step 3:** Writing with Quarto  
4. **Step 4:** Publishing with Quarto

---

## Challenges 
- Learning curve for Git & Quarto  
- Institutional/personal resistance  

---

## Way Forward 
- Start small: Track one project in Git  
- Try writing a Quarto report  
- Shift from proprietary to open-source tools  
- Encourage colleagues to embrace reproducibility
